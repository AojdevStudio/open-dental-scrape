# Open Dental Embeddings Project - Task Log

## Project Overview
Creating specialized embeddings for Open Dental documentation to enable better code understanding and retrieval.

## Specialized Embeddings Approach
We're implementing three types of embeddings:

1. **Content Embeddings**
   - Focus on main text (API documentation, schemas, etc.)
   - Optimized for detailed technical queries
   - Implemented by chunking main documentation content

2. **Metadata Embeddings**
   - Based on tags, categories, version info
   - Help with filtering and categorical searches
   - Attached to each chunk as metadata fields

3. **Relationship Embeddings**
   - Represent connections between components
   - Capture how APIs, database tables, and manual sections relate
   - Enable graph-like queries through vector space

## Tasks Completed

- [x] **2025-03-29** Analyzed Open Dental documentation structure
- [x] **2025-03-29** Created script to process documentation (`prepare_code_embeddings.py`)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Implemented separate embeddings approach (content, metadata, relationships)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Created script to upload embeddings to vector database (`upload_to_vector_db.py`)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Created query interface for vector database (`query_vector_db.py`)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Created pipeline script to run all steps (`run_pipeline.sh`)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Added documentation (`README.md`)
- [x] **2025-03-29** Created task log file (`TASK_LOG.md`)

## Tasks Completed (continued)

- [x] **2025-03-29** Created prepare_code_embeddings.py script with specialized embeddings approach
- [x] **2025-03-29** Updated run_pipeline.sh with improved parameters and documentation
- [x] **2025-03-29** Set up embeddings directory structure with README

## Tasks Pending

- [ ] Test the pipeline with actual Open Dental data
- [ ] Fine-tune the chunk size and overlap parameters (configurable in pipeline script now)
- [ ] Evaluate query performance and adjust as needed
- [ ] Create a UI interface for easier querying (if needed)
- [ ] Consider implementing hybrid search (combination of vector + keyword search)

## Technical Implementation Details

### prepare_code_embeddings.py
- Processes API, database, and manual documentation
- Implements three embedding types:
  - Content Embeddings: Main documentation text chunks
  - Metadata Embeddings: Tags, categories, and version info attached to chunks
  - Relationship Embeddings: Connections between components
- Creates context-aware chunks with configurable size and overlap 
- Extracts relationships between different components
- Enriches chunks with metadata for better retrieval
- Creates relationship-aware chunks by including related components in text
- Handles different document structures for API, database, and manual content
- Formats output for efficient embedding with the OpenAI API
- Outputs embedding-ready chunks in both individual and combined JSON formats
- Generates detailed statistics for monitoring and optimization

### upload_to_vector_db.py
- Loads processed embedding chunks
- Creates embedding vectors using OpenAI API
- Creates a new vector index in OpenAI
- Uploads chunks with vectors to the vector index
- Saves upload statistics for monitoring

### query_vector_db.py
- Provides a CLI interface for querying
- Creates embedding vectors for queries
- Searches the vector index for matching documents
- Enhances results with generated context
- Produces comprehensive answers based on search results

## Next Steps
Next, we need to test the pipeline with real Open Dental documentation data to verify the embedding quality and search accuracy. We may need to adjust parameters like chunk size, overlap, and embedding model to optimize performance.
