Appointments GET Slots
Version Added: 21.1

For simple dental office setups. See also Schedules GET.

This is closer to how search behaves from within Open Dental instead of WebSched. This requires no advanced setup. It looks at open schedule times, whether the schedules are attached to a provider or an operatory.

There are, however, some differences between this and the Search in Open Dental. This returns entire open slots instead of a series of suggested appointment times or the first appointment time for each day. It also currently searches by entire appointment length instead of the XXX provider times on appointments. For providers assigned to a single operatory, the results will be the same as what a person would see if looking at the Appointments Module. If a provider has existing appointments in multiple operatories, it considers all of them as a whole and only returns slots that are available in all operatories for that provider simultaneously.

Most users will specify a ProvNum and an OpNum.

Parameters: All optional.

date: Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. Must be today or a future date. Default is the next 14 days.
dateStart, dateEnd: Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
lengthMinutes: Ignores slots that are shorter than the supplied number of minutes.
ProvNum: ProvNum of a provider. Defaults to the Practice Default Provider.
OpNum: (Added in version 22.1) FK to operatory.OperatoryNum that the provider is assigned to.

Example Requests:
GET /appointments/Slots?date=2021-02-15
GET /appointments/Slots?date=2022-03-30&ProvNum=50&OpNum=16

Appointments GET SlotsWebSched
Version Added: 21.1

Rarely used. Probably just use Appointments GET Slots instead. Offices must be subscribed to WebSched eServices.

This gets slots according to the existing logic used for WebSched existing patient or new patient. Customer must first have gone to Setup WebSched (Existing Patient or New Patient) and done all the setup, including creating Appointment Types and linking Appointment Types to WebSched. This all requires a fair amount of setup on the customer's end, but that restriction is usually preferred when patients are making their own appointments.

After calling this method, use Appointments POST WebSched to create a new WebSched appointment.

date: Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
dateStart, dateEnd: Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. If no dates at all are supplied, the default is the next two weeks.
ClinicNum: Required if clinics are enabled. FK to clinic.ClinicNum.
defNumApptType: Optional. definition.DefNum where definition.Category=42 (NewPat) or 51 (ExistingPat). There must also be an appointmenttype linked to that DefNum and it must be set to be used in WebSched.
isNewPatient: Optional. Defaults to false. Should match the kind of defNumApptType that you use.

Example Request:
GET /appointments/SlotsWebSched?dateStart=2021-02-15&dateEnd=2021-02-15&defNumApptType=326

Appointments GET WebSched
Version Added: 21.3

Rarely used. Probably just use Appointments GET (multiple) instead.

Gets a list of all appointments, indicating which were made through the WebSched service. This is displayed in the eServiceLogType field as either "Recall", "NewPat", "ExistingPat", or "ASAP". Appointments not made through WebSched will have an eServiceLogType of "None".

Parameters: All optional.

date: Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
dateStart, dateEnd: Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
DateTStamp: String in "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" format. Only returns appointments with a DateTStamp altered after the specified date and time.
ClinicNum: ClinicNum of a clinic.

Appointments PUT Break
Version Added: 21.3

Breaks an appointment. Only appointments with an AptStatus of Scheduled can be broken. Creates a CommLog entry if the office has that preference turned on. To reschedule a broken appointment, use Appointments PUT (update) to update the Status, AptDateTime, and Op of the broken appointment.

AptNum: Required in the URL.

sendToUnscheduledList: Required. Either "true" or "false". Usually use "true" to send the broken appointment to the Unscheduled List. This will allow the patient or the office to see that this appointment is ready to be scheduled when they are ready. The only reason you would ever use "false" is if you were setting breakType to "Missed" or "Cancelled". "false" would leave the appointment in place on the appointment book.
breakType: Optional. Rarely used. Only used if you want a procedure to be added, which is usually associated with a fee. Use "Missed" to add a procedure with code D9986, indicating that they missed their appointment without notice. Use "Cancelled" to add procedure with code D9987, indicating less than 24 hrs notice. Normally, if more than 24 hrs notice is given, you would not specify breakType. These options cannot be used unless the offices has gone to Setup > Appointments > Appts Preferences, and changed the broken appointment procedure type to no longer be "None".

Example Request:
PUT /appointments/5/Break

{
"sendToUnscheduledList":"true"
}

Example Response:
200 OK
400 BadRequest (with explanation)
