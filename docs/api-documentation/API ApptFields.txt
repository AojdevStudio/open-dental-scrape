API ApptFields
See API Specification

An ApptField is a highly customizable field that shows on appointments. For example, the office might have an ApptField called "Ins Verified", and you might use the API to set it to "Yes" for a specific appointment. There is some prep work that you must do with the office ahead of time. From within the Open Dental UI at the office, you must first add the field under Setup, Appointments, Appointment Field Defs. There would be additional work to make it also show in the Appt Views and/or Appt Bubble.
