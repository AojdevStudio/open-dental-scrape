EstBalance is a patient's individual balance. BalTotal is a family's total balance and will return 0 unless the patient is the guarantor.

Patients GET Simple
Version Added: 21.2

This is used instead of GET (multiple) if you need to pass in DateTStamp to get recent changes, or if you need additional fields that are not included in GET (multiple).

LName: Supports partial string matching and is case-insensitive.
FName: Supports partial string matching and is case-insensitive.
Birthdate: In "yyyy-mm-dd" format.
ClinicNum: A single ClinicNum. Leave blank if not using clinics or want results for all clinics.
PatStatus: Either "Patient", "NonPatient", "Inactive", "Archived", "Deceased", or "Prospective".
DateTStamp: In "yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss" format.
PriProv: (added in version 21.3) A single ProvNum. Leave blank if you want results for all primary providers.
Gender: (added in version 22.3.6) Either "Male", "Female", "Unknown", or "Other".
Position: (added in version 22.3.6) Either "Single", "Married", "Child", "Widowed", or "Divorced".
Guarantor: (added in version 22.4.19) A single PatNum. The person responsible for the account.
SuperFamily: (added in version 22.4.38) A single PatNum. The head of a SuperFamily.
EmployerNum: (added in version 24.3.30) FK to employer.EmployerNum.

All parameters are optional. If you do not yet have a PatNum and are looking for a specific patient by name, you should generally use a combination of LName, FName, and Birthdate to help ensure uniqueness. Use the DateTStamp to filter results for patients updated in the database since that date. The serverDateTime is included in the response to use for subsequent requests.
EstBalance is a patient's individual balance. BalTotal is a family's total balance and will return 0 unless the patient is the guarantor.
Language is the language used by the patient, typically in ISO 639-2 format, unless custom. Can be "" to indicate "None".

If you are interested in getting specific patients by PK, see PUT queries/ShortQuery for an example query.

Patients GET (multiple)
Version Added: 21.1

You can get a list of patients who meet a set of search criteria. Most string parameters support partial match and are not case sensitive. The parameters and results are very similar to the Patient Select window in Open Dental because it uses the same code. The results do not contain every possible patient field, just the ones that you might see in the Patient Select window. You can GET individual patients if you want more information.

If you do not yet have a PatNum and are looking for a specific patient by name, you should generally use a combination of LName, FName, and Birthdate to help ensure uniqueness.

URL Search Parameters:
LName, FName, Phone, Address, hideInactive, City, State, SSN, ChartNumber, guarOnly, showArchived, Birthdate, SiteNum, SubscriberId, Email, Country, clinicNums (comma separated list), clinicAbbr, invoiceNumber.

Example Requests:
GET /patients?Offset=700
GET /patients?LName=smi
GET /patients?LName=smi&FName=j&Birthdate=1976-05-24&hideInactive=true
