General monthly pricing for API is:

Free - Read All (1 request per 5 seconds throttle)
$15 - Comm, Documents, InsuranceSimple, Setup, and Queries (1 request per 1 second throttle)
$30 - All except Payments, PayPlans, and Special (Special permissions are indicated with * in the Permissions table above)
$35 - All except Special
Pricing is per location. If your organization develops for a large number of practices, contact Open Dental Support to discuss pricing.
