API TreatPlans
See API Specification

Treatment Plans are designed to track treatment the patient has accepted, display treatment charted for the patient that has not been completed, or keep a record of treatment the patient denied.

treatplans with a TPStatus of "Active" or "Inactive" use treatplanattach to reference attached procedures. treatplans with a TPStatus of "Saved" use proctp which are copies of the procedure, and will not change after being saved.

TreatPlans PUT (update)
Version Added: 24.1.10

Updates a treatplan.

To sign a treatplan with TPStatus of "Saved", set isSigned to true for the patient, or isSignedPractice to true for the practice. The signature that appears on the treatplan will be shown as the following: "Digitally Signed by [API DeveloperName] Date Signed: ["MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss tt"]". Every treatplan is required to have at least one Signature box for the patient's signature. The availablity of SignatureText, SignaturePractice, and SignaturePracticeText is dependent upon the default Treatment Plan Sheet of the Clinic associated with the saved treatplan's procedures.

See API Implementation, Treatment Plan Layout, Sign Treatment Plan, and Sheet Def Defaults for more information on signing Treatment Plans.

TPType: Either "Insurance" or "Discount".
SignatureText: The typed name of the person who signed the patient signature.
SignaturePracticeText: The typed name of the person who signed the practice signature.
isSigned: Either "true" or "false". True updates the treatplan Signature, digitally signs for the patient, and overwrites existing signature. False clears the exisiting treatplan Signature.
